        <h2>
          Artistic Inspirations</h2>
        <p>
          It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Impressionism</dt>
          <dd>Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light.
            It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
          </dd>
          <dt>Abstract Expressionism</dt>
          <dd>
            This movement has led to the exploration of non-representional forms and had a significant 
            impact on contemporary art's freedom of expresion,
          </dd>
          <dt>Pop Art</dt>
          <dd>
            A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, 
            leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.
          </dd>
        </dl>
